# Profiling simulation performance

This page covers how to measure where a Genesis World simulation spends its time, through four questions of increasing depth:

- **Throughput:** how many steps per second does the whole scene run? This is the headline number, reported as FPS.
- **Step breakdown:** how much of a step goes to the physics, and how much to the sensors, the viewer, and the recorders around it? The answer tells you whether to optimize the physics at all.
- **Launch latency:** is the GPU actually busy, or is the CPU stalling between kernel launches? This is what limits large parallel simulations that are not yet GPU-bound.
- **Per-kernel time:** which solver kernels dominate a step? This tells you what to optimize.

The first two are built in and always available. The other two use the PyTorch profiler, which works even in a simulation that never touches PyTorch.

## Benchmark against a disposable cache

Before you measure anything, get the compilation cache out of the way. Genesis World compiles GPU kernels just-in-time and caches the results to a persistent local folder, so repeated runs of the same scene start quickly. Quadrants, the compiler, keeps its own cache in the same way. This is what you want for day-to-day work, but it distorts profiling and benchmarking: the first run compiles the kernels, and later runs read them from the warm cache.

Do not wipe the persistent cache to get around this. Its effect outlives your experiment, and every future simulation is slow until the cache rebuilds. Instead, redirect both caches to a throwaway directory for the duration of a single run, by setting a few environment variables:

```bash
XDG_CACHE_HOME="$(mktemp -d)" \
GS_CACHE_FILE_PATH="$XDG_CACHE_HOME/genesis" \
QD_OFFLINE_CACHE_FILE_PATH="$XDG_CACHE_HOME/quadrants" \
python your_script.py
```

- `GS_CACHE_FILE_PATH`: Genesis World's cache directory.
- `QD_OFFLINE_CACHE_FILE_PATH`: the Quadrants compiler cache directory.
- `XDG_CACHE_HOME`: the base cache directory, honored on Linux only.

On Linux, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` alone is enough to relocate the Genesis World cache. On Windows and macOS it is ignored, so set `GS_CACHE_FILE_PATH` and `QD_OFFLINE_CACHE_FILE_PATH` explicitly as shown above.

## Reading the FPS counter

By default, Genesis World prints the achieved step rate to the terminal as the simulation runs. The output looks like this:

```text
Running at 43,000,000.00 FPS (1,433.33 FPS per env, 30000 envs).
```

Three numbers, all reported per window of wall-clock time:

- **Total FPS:** steps per second summed across every environment. This is the throughput figure to compare against benchmarks.
- **Per-env FPS:** the total divided by the number of environments. Useful when comparing scenes with different batch sizes.
- **Environments:** the value of `n_envs` passed to `scene.build()`. It is omitted when the scene has no batch dimension.

Genesis World measures the rate over fixed wall-clock windows and smooths it lightly with an exponential moving average, so it settles to a stable value rather than jumping every step.

### Configuring the counter

The counter is controlled by {py:class}`gs.options.ProfilingOptions <genesis.options.profiling.ProfilingOptions>`, passed to the scene:

```python
scene = gs.Scene(
    profiling_options=gs.options.ProfilingOptions(
        show_FPS=True,       # print the step rate each window; default True
        FPS_tracker_alpha=0.95,  # EMA momentum for the smoothed rate
    ),
)
```

- **`show_FPS`:** whether to print the rate at all. Set it to `False` for quiet runs, or when the log lines interfere with your own output.
- **`FPS_tracker_alpha`:** the smoothing momentum, between 0 and 1. Higher values react more slowly and read more steadily; lower values track sudden changes in speed more closely.

The scene exposes the live options as `scene.profiling_options`, so you can toggle the counter after construction:

```python
scene.profiling_options.show_FPS = False
```

See {doc}`/user_guide/configuration/config_system` for how `ProfilingOptions` fits alongside the other options objects.

## Reading the step breakdown

The FPS counter reports the rate of the whole step, which includes everything the scene does around the physics. To see where that time goes, read `scene.timings` after stepping. It maps each phase of a step to its mean wall time in seconds:

| Phase | Covers |
|---|---|
| `physics` | the solvers advancing the state over the substeps |
| `sensors` | the sensor updates, with `sensors/<class name>` giving the share of each sensor class |
| `rendering` | the viewer refresh |
| `recorders` | the recorders reading the state |
| `video` | the cameras rendering and encoding a frame of a recording |
| `total` | the whole step, the pre-step callbacks included |

A phase the step skips is absent from the mapping, so a scene with no sensors never reports a `sensors` time. The mapping stays empty until the first `scene.step()` returns.

By default each reading covers the last step only, so it jitters from step to step. Set `timings_window` to average over that many steps instead, and a change in speed then takes as many steps to show:

```python
scene = gs.Scene(
    profiling_options=gs.options.ProfilingOptions(
        show_FPS=False,
        timings_window=100,  # average each phase over the last 100 steps
    ),
)
```

Invert a phase to read it as a rate, for instance the step rate of the physics without the sensors, rendering, and recording around it:

```python
physics_fps = 1.0 / scene.timings["physics"]  # steps per second of the physics alone
```

[`examples/rigid/hibernation.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/rigid/hibernation.py) plots this rate live against the number of awake bodies while a pile of objects settles.

:::{warning}
On a GPU backend, a phase measures the host time spent launching its kernels while the device runs them asynchronously, so the phases add up to the real step only on the CPU backend. `total` is accurate on every backend as long as something in the step reads data back from the device, which makes the host wait for it.

## Measuring throughput

The scripts in [`examples/speed_benchmark`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/tree/main/examples/speed_benchmark) are the source of truth for a clean benchmark setup on your own hardware, so the excerpts below only highlight the choices that matter.

[`examples/speed_benchmark/franka.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/speed_benchmark/franka.py) runs a Franka arm across tens of thousands of environments:

```python
gs.init(backend=gs.gpu, performance_mode=True)

scene = gs.Scene(
    rigid_options=gs.options.RigidOptions(dt=0.01),
    show_viewer=False,
)
# ... add plane and franka ...

scene.build(n_envs=30000, env_spacing=(1.0, 1.0))
```

Three choices make this a throughput benchmark rather than an interactive session:

- **`performance_mode=True`** bakes static tensor shapes into the compiled kernels for faster stepping, at the cost of recompiling whenever the scene changes. Use it for a fixed benchmark or a training run, and leave it off while you iterate.
- **`show_viewer=False`** runs headless. Rendering a window caps throughput at display rates and defeats the purpose.
- **A large `n_envs`** keeps the GPU saturated. Throughput scales with the batch until you run out of VRAM.

[`examples/speed_benchmark/anymal_c.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/speed_benchmark/anymal_c.py) is the equivalent for a legged robot. For the reasoning behind these settings and other ways to raise throughput, see {doc}`/user_guide/getting_started/parallel_simulation` and {doc}`/user_guide/policy_training/best_practices/efficient_environment`.

## Timing GPU kernels with the PyTorch profiler

The FPS counter tells you *how fast*, not *why*. To see individual GPU kernels and the gaps between them, attach the PyTorch profiler around the steps you care about. It records CUDA activity whether or not your simulation uses PyTorch tensors.

[`examples/speed_benchmark/timers.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/speed_benchmark/timers.py) wraps a fixed number of steps in a profiler:

```python
with torch.profiler.profile(
    on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler("./benchmark"),
    schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(wait=0, warmup=0, active=1),
    record_shapes=False,
    profile_memory=False,
    with_stack=True,
    with_flops=False,
):
    for step in range(500):
        scene.step()
```

The `schedule` selects which steps to record so you can skip the ones you do not care about. Its phases are:

- **`wait`:** steps to ignore at the start, past any one-time initialization.
- **`warmup`:** steps to run while the profiler primes itself but discards the trace.
- **`active`:** steps actually recorded. One is usually enough and keeps memory low.

When you use a multi-phase schedule, advance it by calling `profiler.step()` once per iteration so the profiler knows which phase it is in. See the [PyTorch profiler schedule documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/profiler.html#torch.profiler.schedule) for details. The resulting trace opens in [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) or, if you export a Chrome trace, in [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).

### Reading the trace

On the GPU timeline you get the precise duration of every kernel launch. White gaps between kernels are launch overhead: the GPU sitting idle while the CPU catches up. On a large parallel simulation those gaps should be negligible; if they dominate, the simulation is CPU-bound and no amount of extra environments will help until the stalls are removed. Diagnosing and removing these stalls is the subject of {doc}`/user_guide/policy_training/best_practices/efficient_environment`.

The GPU timeline has no call hierarchy of its own, so it can be hard to tell which Python-side operation a kernel belongs to. Insert a synchronization before each step to force that alignment:

```python
qd.sync()  # block until all Quadrants GPU work completes, so the CPU and GPU timelines line up
scene.step()
```

:::{warning}
Synchronizing every step serializes the CPU and GPU and can roughly halve throughput. Use it to understand a trace, then remove it before measuring speed.

## Per-solver kernel timings

To go below CUDA kernels and time blocks of work inside the rigid solver, [`examples/speed_benchmark/timers.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/speed_benchmark/timers.py) reads the constraint solver's `timers` array and plots per-environment timings in the terminal:

```python
from genesis.utils.misc import qd_to_torch

timers = qd_to_torch(scene.rigid_solver.constraint_solver.constraint_state.timers)
```

Run it with `--profiling` to attach the PyTorch profiler instead, or without to collect and plot the per-solver timings. This reaches into solver internals and is aimed at contributors optimizing the physics kernels rather than at typical simulation code.
