# Rendering

Camera sensors render a Genesis World scene to images off-screen: color, depth, segmentation, and surface normals, plus video. Unlike the {doc}`viewer </user_guide/interaction/visualization>`, they need no display, so they work headless on a render farm, in a container, or over SSH. This page covers adding a camera, the image types it produces, recording a video, lighting, and the rendering backends, from the fast default rasterizer to photorealistic path tracing.

The complete script is [`examples/tutorials/visualization.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/tutorials/visualization.py).

## Adding a camera

A camera is a sensor you add to the scene. It renders independently of the viewer, so it is the tool for headless rendering and for capturing views from angles other than the viewer's:

```python
cam = scene.add_camera(
    res=(640, 480),  # (width, height) in pixels
    pos=(3.5, 0.0, 2.5),
    lookat=(0, 0, 0.5),
    fov=30,
    GUI=False,
)
```

With `GUI=True`, the camera opens an OpenCV window that displays each rendered frame. This is separate from the viewer window. Leave it `False` when running headless.

## Rendering images

Build the scene, then call `cam.render()`. The camera can produce four image types: color, depth, segmentation mask, and surface normals. Only RGB is rendered by default; enable the others with keyword flags. `render()` always returns the four in the same order, with disabled types returned as `None`:

```python
scene.build()

# render rgb, depth, segmentation, normal
rgb, depth, segmentation, normal = cam.render(rgb=True, depth=True, segmentation=True, normal=True)
```

Each returned array is shaped `(height, width, ...)` following the `res=(width, height)` you set. By default the segmentation mask stores an integer object index per pixel; set `colorize_seg=True` for a viewable color mask. The index maps back to scene objects at the level set by `VisOptions.segmentation_level` (for example, `link_idx` into `scene.rigid_solver.links`).

```

:::{tip}
OpenCV windows opened with `GUI=True` sometimes render black on the first frame. Call `cam.render()` again to refresh them, or `cv2.waitKey(1)`.
:::

## Recording a video

To capture a video, name the file and the framerate on `start_recording()`, step the scene, then call `stop_recording()` to finalize the file. The camera renders itself from within `scene.step()`, so no `cam.render()` call is needed in the loop. Here the camera orbits the scene while the simulation steps:

```python
import math

cam.start_recording(save_to_filename="video.mp4", fps=60)

for i in range(120):
    cam.set_pose(
        pos=(3.0 * math.sin(i / 60), 3.0 * math.cos(i / 60), 2.5),
        lookat=(0, 0, 0.5),
    )
    scene.step()

cam.stop_recording()
```

Frames are encoded and streamed to the file as they are recorded, so the recording length is not limited by memory. `pause_recording()` suspends capture and calling `start_recording()` again resumes the same video, with no gap where the pause was; the filename and framerate are fixed for a whole video and cannot be given again on resume.

One second of video covers one second of `ViewerOptions.realtime_factor`-paced time whatever the framerate, so lowering `fps` costs temporal resolution rather than changing playback speed. Frames sit a whole number of simulation steps apart, so a requested framerate that `dt` cannot hit exactly is rounded to the closest achievable one, with a warning. If you omit `save_to_filename`, Genesis World generates a name from the calling script; if you omit `fps` it defaults to 60. The result:

<video preload="auto" controls="True" width="100%">
<source src="../../_static/videos/cam_record.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

For recording sensor and simulation data (not just video) on a schedule, see {doc}`Recording data </user_guide/sensing/recorders>`.

## Lighting

The rasterizer (the viewer and any rasterizer camera sensor) lights the scene from a list of lights on `VisOptions`. With no configuration it uses a single directional light, so scenes are lit out of the box; set `lights` to control direction, color, and intensity yourself. The light classes live in `gs.options.vis`:

```python
scene = gs.Scene(
    vis_options=gs.options.VisOptions(
        lights=[
            gs.options.vis.DirectionalLight(
                dir=(-1, -1, -1),  # direction the light travels, world frame
                color=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),  # RGB in [0, 1]
                intensity=5.0,
            ),
            gs.options.vis.PointLight(
                pos=(2.0, 0.0, 3.0),  # meters, world frame
                color=(1.0, 0.9, 0.8),
                intensity=8.0,
            ),
        ],
        ambient_light=(0.1, 0.1, 0.1),  # uniform fill so shadows are not pure black
    ),
)
```

Two light types are available:

- **{py:class}`DirectionalLight <genesis.options.vis.DirectionalLight>`:** parallel rays from a fixed direction, like sunlight. Set `dir` (the direction the light travels), `color`, and `intensity`. Position does not matter.
- **{py:class}`PointLight <genesis.options.vis.PointLight>`:** light radiating outward from a point. Set `pos`, `color`, and `intensity`.

Ambient light is a separate, uniform fill set through the `ambient_light` field rather than an entry in `lights`.

:::{note}
This controls the rasterizer only. The ray tracer has no light objects: lights there are entities with an {py:class}`Emission <genesis.options.surfaces.Emission>` surface, covered in {doc}`Surfaces and textures <surfaces_textures>`. The `BatchRenderer` backend instead takes lights at runtime through `scene.add_light(...)`.

## Rendering backends

`gs.Scene(renderer=...)` selects how camera sensors turn the scene into pixels. Genesis World provides:

- `gs.renderers.Rasterizer()`: the default. Fast, and what the viewer always uses.
- `gs.renderers.RayTracer()`: a path tracer for photorealistic stills (see [below](#photorealistic-rendering-with-luisa-deprecating)).
- `gs.renderers.BatchRenderer(...)`: high-throughput rendering across many environments (see [Batch rendering with gs-madrona](#batch-rendering-with-gs-madrona)).

### Photorealistic rendering with Nyx

**Nyx** is the recommended path toward photorealistic rendering. Unlike the backends above, it attaches as a camera *sensor* rather than a scene-wide renderer: you add a `NyxCameraOptions` sensor and read frames back from `cam.read().rgb`. It supports PBR materials, HDRI lighting, 3D Gaussian splat assets, multi-camera and multi-environment rendering, and per-pixel object picking. See the {doc}`Nyx renderer <nyx_renderer>` page for installation, a minimal example, and the full feature set.

:::{note}
**Roadmap.** We are unifying rasterization and path tracing under Nyx as a single, sensor-based rendering interface. Nyx will gradually replace both the Luisa backend below and the default rasterizer. Over time, all camera-based rendering in Genesis World will go through Nyx.
:::

### Photorealistic rendering with Luisa (deprecating)

Genesis World also ships a Luisa-based ray-tracing backend. Enable it by passing `renderer=gs.renderers.RayTracer()` when creating the scene; it exposes extra parameters such as `spp`, `aperture`, and camera `model`.

:::{warning}
This backend is deprecated in favor of Nyx and requires building `LuisaRender` from source. Prefer Nyx for new work.
:::

Setup, tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with CUDA 12.4 and Python 3.9:

1. Fetch the submodule and install the render extras:

   ```bash
   # inside the genesis-world repo
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   pip install -e ".[render]"
   ```

2. Ensure `gcc`/`g++` >= 11 and CMake >= 3.26 are on your `PATH`, and install the Vulkan, X11, UUID, and zlib development headers (via `apt` with sudo, or `conda install -c conda-forge` without).

3. Build `LuisaRender`:

   ```bash
   cd genesis/ext/LuisaRender
   cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D PYTHON_VERSIONS=3.9 \
       -D LUISA_COMPUTE_DOWNLOAD_NVCOMP=ON -D LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_GUI=OFF \
       -D LUISA_RENDER_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
   cmake --build build -j $(nproc)
   ```

4. Run the demo:

   ```bash
   cd examples/rendering
   python demo.py
   ```

```{figure} ../../_static/images/raytracing_demo.png
:alt: A scene rendered photorealistically with the Luisa ray-tracing backend
```

:::{note}
Prebuilt LuisaRender binaries for common CUDA and Python combinations are available [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ah580EIylJJ0v2vGOeSBU_b8zPDWESxS?usp=sharing), named `build_<commit-tag>_cuda<version>_python<version>`. Download the one matching your system, rename it to `build/`, and place it in `genesis/ext/LuisaRender`. For build and CUDA-toolkit troubleshooting, see the [genesis-world README](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world#quick-installation).

### Batch rendering with gs-madrona

For high-throughput rendering across many parallel environments, use the gs-madrona backend by passing `renderer=gs.renderers.BatchRenderer(use_rasterizer=True)` (set `use_rasterizer=False` to path-trace instead).

Install the package first. Prebuilt wheels are available on PyPI for x86 and Python >= 3.10:

```bash
pip install gs-madrona
```

Then run the bundled example, which writes frames to `./image_output`:

```bash
python examples/rigid/single_franka_batch_render.py
```

Unlike the rasterizer, the batch renderer takes its lights at runtime through `scene.add_light(...)` after the scene is created, rather than from `VisOptions`:

```python
scene.add_light(
    pos=(0.0, 0.0, 10.0),   # position, used for positional lights
    dir=(0.0, 0.0, -1.0),   # direction the light travels, normalized internally
    color=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),  # RGB, each channel in [0, 1]
    intensity=1.0,
    directional=True,       # parallel rays if True, positional if False
    castshadow=True,
    cutoff=45.0,            # spotlight cutoff angle, degrees
    attenuation=0.0,        # distance falloff for positional lights
)
```
