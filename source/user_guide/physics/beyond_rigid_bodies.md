# Beyond rigid bodies

The {doc}`Hello, Genesis World </user_guide/getting_started/hello_genesis>` tutorial simulated a rigid robot. But a scene can hold water, sand, cloth, and soft tissue at the same time, because Genesis World unifies several physics **solvers** under one `Scene`. A solver is the set of algorithms that advances one family of materials; the material you assign to an entity decides which solver simulates it.

This page introduces the non-rigid solvers, explains when to reach for each, and links a runnable example per solver. It is an overview: read it to choose a solver, then follow the linked example for the full script.

## Choosing a solver

Every entity carries a `material`. In {doc}`Hello, Genesis World </user_guide/getting_started/hello_genesis>` the material defaulted to `gs.materials.Rigid()`, so the rigid solver handled the arm. Assign a material from a different family and its solver runs instead:

| Solver | Representation | Reach for it when you need | Materials (`gs.materials.<S>.*`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MPM** (Material Point Method) | Hybrid particles + background grid | The widest range of continuum materials in one solver: elastic, plastic, sand, snow | `Elastic`, `Liquid`, `ElastoPlastic`, `Sand`, `Snow`, `Muscle` |
| **FEM** (Finite Element Method) | Tetrahedral mesh | Accurate elasticity and volumetric muscles, where mesh fidelity matters | `Elastic`, `Cloth`, `Muscle` |
| **PBD** (Position-Based Dynamics) | Particles + constraints | Fast cloth, ropes, and topology-preserving deformables | `Cloth`, `Elastic`, `Liquid`, `Particle` |
| **SPH** (Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics) | Particles (Lagrangian) | Free-surface liquids driven by real fluid parameters | `Liquid` |

MPM and SPH also power {doc}`particle emitters <emitters>`; MPM and FEM power {doc}`volumetric soft robots <soft_robots>`.

## The pattern shared by every non-rigid solver

Whichever solver you use, three things change relative to a rigid-only scene.

**1. Enable substepping.** Non-rigid solvers are numerically stiff, so each `scene.step()` is subdivided into several substeps. Set a small `dt` (in seconds) and a substep count on `SimOptions`; the internal substep is `dt / substeps`. Rigid-only scenes leave `substeps` at its default of `1`.

```python
sim_options=gs.options.SimOptions(
    dt=4e-3,  # seconds
    substeps=10,  # substep_dt = 4e-4 s
)
```

**2. Configure the solver on the scene.** Each solver reads its own options object: `MPMOptions`, `SPHOptions`, `FEMOptions`, `PBDOptions`. Particle-grid solvers (MPM, SPH) require a simulation domain; entities that leave `lower_bound`/`upper_bound` (in meters, Z-up) are clamped to it.

```python
mpm_options=gs.options.MPMOptions(
    lower_bound=(-0.5, -1.0, 0.0),  # meters
    upper_bound=(0.5, 1.0, 1.0),
)
```

**3. Set the material and how it renders.** Swap the entity's `material` to pick the solver, and pass a `surface` to control appearance. `vis_mode="particle"` draws the underlying particles; `vis_mode="visual"` deforms the original mesh to follow the internal state (called *skinning* in computer graphics).

```python
obj = scene.add_entity(
    material=gs.materials.MPM.Elastic(),
    morph=gs.morphs.Box(pos=(0.0, -0.5, 0.25), size=(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)),
    surface=gs.surfaces.Default(color=(1.0, 0.4, 0.4), vis_mode="visual"),
)
```

## MPM: deformable and granular materials

The Material Point Method carries mass on particles while resolving forces on a background grid, which lets one solver span elastic solids, plastics, sand, and snow. Reach for MPM when you want several continuum behaviors in the same scene, or a material that flows and then holds its deformed shape.

Only the `material` differs between an elastic cube, a liquid cube, and an elastoplastic sphere:

```python
scene.add_entity(material=gs.materials.MPM.Elastic(), ...)
scene.add_entity(material=gs.materials.MPM.Liquid(), ...)
scene.add_entity(material=gs.materials.MPM.ElastoPlastic(), ...)
```

## FEM: accurate elasticity and muscles

The Finite Element Method discretizes an entity into a tetrahedral mesh and solves the elasticity equations on it. Choose FEM over MPM when mesh-level accuracy matters: stiff elastic bodies, volumetric muscles, and contact-rich soft-body manipulation. {py:class}`gs.materials.FEM.Elastic <genesis.engine.materials.FEM.elastic.Elastic>` exposes the physical parameters directly, such as Young's modulus `E` (Pa) and Poisson ratio `nu`.

A FEM entity renders from the mesh it was authored with rather than from its tetrahedral boundary, so each sub-mesh keeps its own material, texture, and UVs and segmentation resolves per sub-mesh. The entity exposes them as `entity.vgeoms`, mirroring the rigid entity's visual geoms; see the {doc}`FEMEntity reference </api_reference/engine/entity/fem_entity>`.

FEM underpins the {doc}`soft robots tutorial <soft_robots>`, which actuates a volumetric muscle. FEM entities also couple to rigid arms for grasping; see [`examples/coupling/fem_cube_linked_with_arm.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/coupling/fem_cube_linked_with_arm.py).

## PBD: cloth and topology-preserving deformables

Position-Based Dynamics represents an entity as particles linked by constraints and solves for positions directly, which makes it fast and stable for cloth, ropes, and other 1D/2D/3D bodies that keep their topology. {py:class}`gs.materials.PBD.Cloth <genesis.engine.materials.PBD.cloth.Cloth>` loads a 2D mesh as a sheet.

You can pin individual particles after building. `find_closest_particle` locates the particle nearest a world-space point (meters), and `fix_particles` anchors it:

```python
scene.build()

# pin all four corners of the sheet in place
cloth.fix_particles(cloth.find_closest_particle((-1, -1, 1.0)))
cloth.fix_particles(cloth.find_closest_particle((1, 1, 1.0)))
```

:::{warning}
Skinning a flat 2D cloth mesh with `vis_mode="visual"` can produce degenerate barycentric weights, which shows up as distorted rendering, especially with a non-zero `euler`. Use `vis_mode="particle"` for flat sheets until this is resolved.

## SPH: free-surface liquids

Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics is a purely Lagrangian (particle-only) solver aimed at liquids. Reach for SPH when you want fluid governed by physical parameters — rest density `rho` (kg/m³), viscosity `mu`, and surface tension `gamma` — rather than the coarser liquid model MPM provides.

Turning a rigid block into water is one line: give it an SPH liquid material. Tune the flow with its parameters:

```python
liquid = scene.add_entity(
    material=gs.materials.SPH.Liquid(),  # or Liquid(mu=0.02, gamma=0.02) for a thicker fluid
    morph=gs.morphs.Box(pos=(0.0, 0.0, 0.65), size=(0.4, 0.4, 0.4)),
    surface=gs.surfaces.Default(color=(0.4, 0.8, 1.0), vis_mode="particle"),
)
```

Read live particle positions with `liquid.get_particles_pos()`, which returns a tensor of shape `([n_envs,] n_particles, 3)` in meters.

:::{note}
The `Liquid` material accepts a `sampler` that controls how particles fill the morph: `"regular"` (a grid lattice, the SPH default for numerical stability), `"pbs"` (physics-based sampling, which runs extra steps for a natural arrangement), or `"random"`.

## SF: gaseous phenomena (smoke)

The Stable Fluid solver is grid-based (Eulerian), not particle-based: it advects a velocity field and one or more scalar density fields on a fixed 3D grid, then makes the velocity divergence-free with a Jacobi pressure projection. Reach for it for smoke and other gases. Set the grid resolution with `SFOptions.res`.

Unlike the other non-rigid solvers, SF has no Lagrangian entity you add and move. Gas enters through velocity **jets** you register on the solver, and the solver stays inactive until at least one jet exists. Each substep advects the velocity and density fields (RK3 backtracing with trilinear interpolation), injects momentum at the jets, then runs `solver_iters` Jacobi pressure iterations to keep the velocity divergence-free. State lives on the fixed grid, so there are no per-entity get/set methods, and SF does not participate in checkpointing. Read the density grid back for rendering.
