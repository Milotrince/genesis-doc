# Rigid bodies

A rigid body is the default kind of entity in Genesis World: a solid that does not deform, simulated by the rigid solver. It is what you get from {doc}`Hello, Genesis World </user_guide/getting_started/hello_genesis>`, and it covers most of robotics: robot arms, grippers, mobile bases, and the props they interact with. The rest of this section covers the non-rigid families that build on the same `Scene`.

## Adding a rigid body

An entity is rigid whenever its `material` is {py:class}`gs.materials.Rigid <genesis.engine.materials.rigid.Rigid>`, which is the default, so you usually pass only a {doc}`morph </user_guide/assets/loading_assets>`:

```python
box = scene.add_entity(gs.morphs.Box(pos=(0, 0, 0.5), size=(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)))
franka = scene.add_entity(gs.morphs.MJCF(file="xml/franka_emika_panda/panda.xml"))
```

Both are rigid entities. The box is a single body; the Franka is **articulated**, a tree of rigid **links** connected by **joints**.

## Single bodies and articulated bodies

Every rigid entity is a {py:class}`RigidEntity <genesis.engine.entities.rigid_entity.rigid_entity.RigidEntity>`, driven through its own methods rather than a global handle. An articulated entity exposes its structure:

- **Links** (`entity.links`, `entity.n_links`): the individual rigid bodies in the tree.
- **Joints** (`entity.joints`, `entity.n_joints`): the connections between links.
- **Degrees of freedom** (`entity.n_dofs`): the independent coordinates the joints move along. A single free body has 6 dofs; a fixed box has none.

Read and write state through the entity: `get_pos()` and `get_quat()` for the base pose, and `get_dofs_position()` for joint positions. {doc}`Control your robot </user_guide/getting_started/control_your_robot>` covers driving those dofs with a controller, and {doc}`Robot control </user_guide/robot_control/inverse_kinematics_motion_planning>` does the same for arms.

## Fixed and free bases

Whether an entity's base is bolted to the world or floats freely depends on the morph. An MJCF file specifies the base joint itself; a URDF base is free (a 6-dof joint to the world) unless you pass `fixed=True`. See {doc}`Loading assets </user_guide/assets/loading_assets>` for the details.

## Physical properties

The rigid material sets how a body interacts physically. Pass a configured `gs.materials.Rigid` to override the defaults:

```python
box = scene.add_entity(
    gs.morphs.Box(pos=(0, 0, 0.5), size=(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)),
    material=gs.materials.Rigid(
        rho=1000.0,               # density in kg/m3, used to estimate mass
        friction=1.0,             # sliding (Coulomb) friction coefficient
        friction_torsional=0.005, # resists spin about the contact normal (meters)
        friction_rolling=0.0001,  # resists rolling about the tangent axes (meters)
    ),
)
```

Torsional and rolling friction take effect only once you enable them on the solver, since they add constraint rows to every contact:

```python
scene = gs.Scene(
    rigid_options=gs.options.RigidOptions(
        friction_cone=gs.friction_cone.elliptic,  # exact isotropic cone (default: pyramidal)
        enable_torsional_friction=True,
        enable_rolling_friction=True,              # requires enable_torsional_friction
    ),
)
```

Choose the elliptic `friction_cone` when resting objects have to stay put rather than creeping slowly. Paired with the default Newton `constraint_solver` it also unlocks the `signorini` contact resolution, which we then select by default: friction is bounded by the normal force the contact has developed, so a fast-sliding body decelerates at `friction` times gravity instead of lifting off a flat floor. Set `contact_resolution` explicitly to override that choice.

Two examples isolate what each coefficient buys you: [`examples/rigid/torsional_grasp.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/rigid/torsional_grasp.py) pinches a ball between two plates and spins it, which a point contact cannot resist without `friction_torsional`, and [`examples/rigid/rolling_coast.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/rigid/rolling_coast.py) launches two balls rolling side by side, where only the one carrying a `friction_rolling` coefficient coasts to a stop.

The rigid solver governs how these bodies actually push on each other: contact, collision geometry, and constraints. {doc}`Theory and modeling </user_guide/theory/rigid_solver/index>` documents that model, and covers {doc}`contact resolution </user_guide/theory/rigid_solver/constraints>` in full.
