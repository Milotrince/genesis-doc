# Drone entity

A {py:class}`DroneEntity <genesis.engine.entities.rigid_entity.drone_entity.DroneEntity>` is a quadrotor whose actuation is its four propeller speeds. Unlike a robot arm, it takes no joint torques or positions: set each propeller's angular velocity in **RPM** (revolutions per minute), and Genesis World converts those speeds into the aerodynamic forces that lift and steer the drone.

The examples below use the Crazyflie 2.X model that ships with Genesis World. For the class API, see the {doc}`DroneEntity reference </api_reference/engine/entity/drone_entity>`.

## How propeller RPM becomes motion

Each simulation step, Genesis World reads every propeller's commanded RPM and applies two things to that propeller's link:

- **Thrust**, a force along the propeller's local +Z axis: `F = KF · rpm²`.
- **Reaction torque**, a yaw moment about the same axis: `τ = KM · rpm² · spin`, where `spin` is `+1` for a counter-clockwise propeller and `-1` for a clockwise one.

`KF` (thrust coefficient) and `KM` (moment coefficient) come from the drone's URDF, so they are fixed properties of the model. Thrust grows with the *square* of RPM, so control is nonlinear: doubling RPM roughly quadruples lift.

Two consequences follow, and they are the whole basis of quadrotor control:

- **Common RPM sets altitude.** Spinning all four propellers equally produces pure vertical thrust. There is a hover RPM at which total thrust balances gravity.
- **Differential RPM sets attitude.** Speeding up one side relative to the other tilts the drone (roll/pitch), which redirects the thrust vector and produces horizontal motion. Speeding up the counter-clockwise pair relative to the clockwise pair leaves a net yaw torque, which rotates the drone in place.

Drone entities do not support collision checking. They interact with the world only through the propeller forces described above and through gravity.

## Minimal example: hover

The complete runnable script for programmed flight is [`examples/drone/fly.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/drone/fly.py). The following is the smallest program that keeps a drone aloft: create it, then set every propeller to the hover RPM on each step.

```python
import genesis as gs

gs.init(backend=gs.cpu)

scene = gs.Scene(
    sim_options=gs.options.SimOptions(dt=0.01),  # gravity defaults to (0, 0, -9.81) m/s2
)
scene.add_entity(gs.morphs.Plane())
drone = scene.add_entity(
    gs.morphs.Drone(file="urdf/drones/cf2x.urdf", pos=(0.0, 0.0, 0.5)),
)

scene.build()

hover_rpm = 14468.429  # balances gravity for the CF2X model
for _ in range(1000):
    drone.set_propellers_rpm([hover_rpm, hover_rpm, hover_rpm, hover_rpm])
    scene.step()
```

The hover RPM is model-specific: it is the value at which `4 · KF · rpm²` equals the drone's weight, approximately 14468 RPM for the shipped Crazyflie 2.X.

## Drone morph

The morph is a URDF loaded through {py:class}`gs.morphs.Drone <genesis.options.morphs.Drone>`. The defaults match the Crazyflie model, so `file` and `pos` are usually all you need:

```python
drone = scene.add_entity(
    gs.morphs.Drone(
        file="urdf/drones/cf2x.urdf",
        model="CF2X",  # "CF2X", "CF2P", or "RACE"
        pos=(0.0, 0.0, 0.5),  # meters, Z-up
        euler=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),  # scipy extrinsic x-y-z, degrees
        propellers_link_name=("prop0_link", "prop1_link", "prop2_link", "prop3_link"),
        propellers_spin=(-1, 1, -1, 1),  # per propeller: -1 = CW, +1 = CCW
    ),
)
```

`propellers_link_name` fixes the *order* in which propellers are indexed: `set_propellers_rpm` maps its RPM array to these links positionally. `propellers_spin` gives each propeller's rotation direction, which sets the sign of its yaw reaction torque. The `RACE` model inverts all four spins internally.

The bundled models are:

| `model` | `file` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CF2X` | `urdf/drones/cf2x.urdf` | Crazyflie 2.X, X rotor layout |
| `CF2P` | `urdf/drones/cf2p.urdf` | Crazyflie 2.X, plus rotor layout |
| `RACE` | `urdf/drones/racer.urdf` | Racing quadrotor |

## Setting propeller RPM

`set_propellers_rpm` is the single actuation call. It takes one RPM per propeller:

```python
propellers_rpm  # shape ([n_envs,] n_propellers), non-negative
```

:::{warning}
Call `set_propellers_rpm` **exactly once per step**, before `scene.step()`. A second call in the same step raises an error, because each call accumulates the propeller revolution count that drives the spin animation.
:::

To move rather than hover, offset individual propellers from the hover RPM. The interactive example [`examples/drone/interactive_drone.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/drone/interactive_drone.py) maps a direction to a per-propeller offset around a common thrust:

```python
# cur_dir is a 4-vector of per-propeller deltas in [-1, 1]
clipped_dir = np.clip(self.cur_dir, -1.0, 1.0)
rpms = self.thrust + clipped_dir * self.rotation_delta
return np.clip(rpms, 0, 25000)  # keep RPM within the motor's range
```

The direction vectors show the pattern directly: moving forward uses `(1, 1, -1, -1)` (front pair up, rear pair down, so the drone pitches forward), while yaw-style rotation uses `(-1, 1, -1, 1)`, matching the propeller spin directions.

## Closed-loop control

Open-loop RPM schedules drift. To fly to a target position, close the loop on the drone's state, which `DroneEntity` exposes through the getters it inherits from `RigidEntity`:

```python
pos = drone.get_pos()  # shape ([n_envs,] 3), meters
vel = drone.get_vel()  # shape ([n_envs,] 3), m/s
quat = drone.get_quat()  # shape ([n_envs,] 4), (w, x, y, z)
```

[`examples/drone/quadcopter_controller.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/drone/quadcopter_controller.py) implements a cascaded PID controller (position → velocity → attitude) whose final stage is a **mixer** that turns desired thrust, roll, pitch, and yaw corrections into four motor RPMs:

```python
M1 = self.__base_rpm + (thrust - roll - pitch - yaw - x_vel + y_vel)
M2 = self.__base_rpm + (thrust - roll + pitch + yaw + x_vel + y_vel)
M3 = self.__base_rpm + (thrust + roll + pitch - yaw + x_vel - y_vel)
M4 = self.__base_rpm + (thrust + roll - pitch + yaw - x_vel - y_vel)
```

Each correction adds or subtracts across the four motors according to its sign pattern. Run the full point-to-point flight with [`examples/drone/fly_route.py`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-world/blob/main/examples/drone/fly_route.py), which drives this controller and clamps each RPM to a safe range before applying it.

## Multiple environments

RPM control batches across {doc}`parallel environments </user_guide/getting_started/parallel_simulation>`. Build with `n_envs`, then pass one RPM row per environment:

```python
scene.build(n_envs=32)

# shape (n_envs, n_propellers)
rpms = np.tile([hover_rpm] * drone.n_propellers, (32, 1))
drone.set_propellers_rpm(rpms)
```
